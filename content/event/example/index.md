summary: Characterization of Immune Repertoires in Dogs with Neurologic Disease
abstract: Adaptive immunity is mediated by antigen receptors on lymphocytes. These receptors are non-germline encoded and are created at random in every lymphocyte. Lymphocyte antigen receptors facilitate the recognition of foreign or self-antigen, and the abundance of specific clones that are encountered in an individual reflects prior contact. Consequently, understanding the composition of an individualâ€™s immune repertoire, i.e. the range of lymphocyte antigen receptor sequences, can yield insights into infectious or immune-mediated conditions. Given the vastness of the antigen receptor sequence space, it is essential to reduce its complexity by identifying similar, functionally related sequences by clustering. However, the clustering of immune repertoire data is challenging due to the computational cost associated with pairwise sequence comparison. To overcome this limitation, I developed Anchor Clustering, an unsupervised clustering method designed to identify similar sequences from millions of antigen receptor gene sequences was created (Chapter 2). The results demonstrate that Anchor Clustering is faster than existing pairwise comparison clustering methods while achieving similar clustering quality. I then applied Anchor Clustering to characterize immune repertoires in dogs with neurologic disease across two different anatomical compartments. I first provide a detailed analysis of variable and joining gene usage is provided firstly and a network analysis for immune repertoires in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from dogs with neurologic disease is performed (Chapter 3). I then characterize immune repertoires in the nervous tissue (NT) from dogs with Meningoencephalitides of Unknown Origin (MUO), a common and devastating disease of dogs (Chapter 4). Lastly, I investigate the shared repertoire space between the CSF and NT compartments (Chapter 5). I show that immune repertoires in both compartments share similar V/J gene usage and k-mer frequencies, and I identify receptor sequences that are found in both compartments and that are associated with distinct diseases. These findings show that CSF samples can be used to interrogate disease processes in the NT and that disease-associated immune repertoires could be harnessed as an ante-mortem tool for the diagnosis of central nervous system diseases in dogs.
