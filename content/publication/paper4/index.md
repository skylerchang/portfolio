abstract: Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) catalyzes the reversible reaction of l-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate into oxaloacetate and l-glutamate and plays a key role in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in all organisms. In human tissues, GOTs are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzymes which exist in cytoplasm and mitochondrial forms, GOT1 and GOT2, respectively. GOT1 expression correlates with the growth of several tumors because cancer cells can utilize the amino acid glutamine to fuel anabolic processes, and therefore, GOT1 represents a new therapeutic target in cancer.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this work, the mature form of human GOT1 was expressed to a high level in Escherichia coli periplasmic space using pET-22b vector, purified by a combination of immobilized metal-affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography.
