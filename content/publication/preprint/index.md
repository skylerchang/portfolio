Introduction
The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a valued companion animal and a model for virally induced cancers and immunodeficiencies. However, species-specific limitations such as a scarcity of immune cell markers constrain our ability to resolve immune cell subsets at sufficient detail. The goal of this study was to characterize circulating feline T cells and other leukocytes based on their transcriptomic landscape and T-cell receptor repertoire using single cell RNA-sequencing.

Methods.
Peripheral blood from 4 healthy cats was enriched for T cells by flow cytometry cell sorting using a mouse anti-feline CD5 monoclonal antibody. Libraries for whole transcriptome, alpha/beta T cell receptor transcripts and gamma/delta T cell receptor transcripts were constructed using the 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5â€™ reagent kit and the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit with custom reverse primers for the feline orthologs.

Results.
Unsupervised clustering of whole transcriptome data revealed 7 major cell populations - T cells, neutrophils, monocytic cells, B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mast cells and platelets. Sub cluster analysis of T cells resolved naive (CD4+ and CD8+), CD4+ effector T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and gamma/delta T cells. Cross species analysis revealed a high conservation of T cell subsets along an effector gradient with equitable representation of veterinary species (horse, dog, pig) and humans with the cat. Our V(D)J repertoire analysis demonstrated a skewed T-cell receptor alpha gene usage and a restricted T-cell receptor gamma junctional length in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells compared to other alpha/beta T cell subsets. Among myeloid cells, we resolved three clusters of classical monocytes with polarization into pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes in addition to a cluster of conventional dendritic cells. Lastly, our neutrophil sub clustering revealed a larger mature neutrophil cluster and a smaller exhausted/activated cluster.

Discussion.
Our study is the first to characterize subsets of circulating T cells utilizing an integrative approach of single cell RNA-sequencing, V(D)J repertoire analysis and cross species analysis. In addition, we characterize the transcriptome of several myeloid cell subsets and demonstrate immune cell relatedness across different species.
