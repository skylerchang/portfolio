      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research Experience'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        In my role as a bioinformatics professional, I have demonstrated proficiency in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, showcasing a range of essential skills. I am experienced in variant calling using Freebayes, particularly adept at extracting meaningful insights from 10x Genomics BAM files. Notably, I have successfully navigated the challenges posed by large datasets, routinely working with collections exceeding one million cells. My expertise extends to conducting RNA velocity analyses, providing a dynamic perspective on gene expression patterns. Additionally, I have a keen interest in mutational signature analysis, unraveling the genomic landscape of individual cells. Leveraging tools such as cellranger, I have efficiently processed FASTA files, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of my analyses. My skill set also encompasses isoform analysis, further enhancing my ability to dissect the intricacies of scRNA-seq data. 
        
        I am eager to contribute these skills and experiences to a dynamic team in a challenging bioinformatics role.
