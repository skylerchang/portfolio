      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research Experience'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
          In my role as a bioinformatician, I have demonstrated proficiency in analyzing immune repertoire sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Notably, I have successfully developed an effective algorithm for clustering large-scale immune repertoire datasets, achieving the clustering of one million unique sequences in five minutes while maintaining high speed and optimum clustering quality. My expertise also extends to visualizing clustering results with both static and dynamic network connections. Additionally, I have a keen interest in conducting various functional analyses of scRNA-seq, including transcription factor regulation, cell communication, differential gene expression, trajectory analysis, and spatial transcriptomics.

          Driven by a problem-solving mindset and quick learning skills, I have enhanced my ability to dissect the intricacies of scRNA-seq data. My advanced programming skills in Python and R, coupled with my background in immunology, make me a strong candidate for bioinformatics and computational biology roles in dynamic research teams working on challenging projects. Please reach out to collaborate. ðŸ˜ƒ
